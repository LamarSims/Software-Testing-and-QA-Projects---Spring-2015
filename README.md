# Software-Testing-and-QA-Projects---Spring-2015
Software Testing and QA College Project from Georgia Southern University

Group Project

First Project: Testing the Selenium application
This Software Quality Assurance Plan will usher in the process and procedures for performing Software Quality Assurance for the Selenium
Testing project.

This plan provides the skeleton for which quality assurance activities will be handled and managed and is based on the two main components
of Selenium, our work products. It maps out the requirements of the testing team, defines the milestones of the testing plan and how they
will be conducted, and identifies the SQA work products.

Second Project: Using Selenium to test applications/webpages
Selenium is a software testing tool used to formulate automatic test scripts for web applications. At just over a decade old, it uses a
Javascript library that drives interaction with the tested website and allows users to generate test cases with the click of a button.
This becomes very handy when most testers want to rerun their test cases without manually stepping through every node. This open source
tool provides a test suite through an IDE that has a record feature that can generate, edit, and debug test cases on its easy-to-use
interface. This can be done on any given web application. Selenium underscores the value of testing due to its ability to test across
multiple platforms (such as multiple web browsers and multiple operating systems.
